# Superstore Sales Analysis

### Project Overview:
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of 4 years (2019-2022) sales data from a superstore, focusing on performance across different regions, states, segments, and product categories. It examines key metrics such as revenue, profit, loss, number of orders, and discount  offering insights into geographical and product-level performance. The analysis identifies high-performing areas, underperforming categories/subcategories, and seasonal trends, while also highlighting opportunities for improvement and business growth.

### Insights:
- After a slight drop in the year of COVID, 2020, revenue increased gradually. However, profit always had increase over the 4 years.
- Sales MoM% (Month-over-Month Percent Change in Sales) and Profit MoM% from early 2019 to the end of 2022 do not always show aligned behaviour. Profit may drop even when sales rise, indicating increased costs or discounts.
- There are potential seasonal sales patterns.Februaryâ€“March of each year tends to show noticeable activity. Also, December-January seems to have low sales.
- Consumer segment has the highest revenue (50%) and profit (47%). Followed by Corporate segment.
- Most of the revenue and profit is generated from New York and California. There are some states (e.g., Texas,Ohio,Pennsylvania) that are incurring losses.
- Among the three categories of the superstore, 51% of the total profit comes from Technology category, while Office Supplies category contributes 43%.
- Comparing profitable and unprofitable subcategories shows that some subcategories show losses despite strong sales and order volumes.It is may be due to the high discount offerings despite having popularity in low discount upto 30%.

### Recommendations:
- Adjust pricing to maintain margins on high-performing items.
- Limit discounts to strategic times (e.g., clearance, end-of-season).
- Offer lower discounts on high-demand products.
- Prioritize marketing to Consumer segment.
- Expand production in the Technology category.
- Examine operations, competition, customer behaviour and consider region-specific marketing strategies improve performance in underperforming states.
